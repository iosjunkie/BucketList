# BucketList
An exercise about maps, biometric authentication, and the usual.

#### What I learned
- Using computed property in enum to return a boolean variable depending on case
- Alert can either have dismiss button only, or primary and secondary button
- Using encode and decode to write and load json file from the disk
- MapView, definitely
- LocalAuthentication biometrics and passcode
